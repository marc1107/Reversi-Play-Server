    <h2>Objective</h2>
    <p>The object of the game is to place your discs on the board so as to outflank your opponent's discs, flipping them over to your color. The player who has the most discs on the board at the end of the game wins.</p>

    <h2>Setup</h2>
    <p>Reversi is played on an 8x8 board. Each player chooses a color: black or white. The game starts with four discs placed in the center of the board in a square of alternating colors.</p>

    <h2>Gameplay</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Players take turns making moves. A move consists of placing a disc on the board such that it outflanks one or more of the opponent's discs.</li>
      <li>Outflanking means trapping one or more opponent's discs between two of your own along a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line.</li>
      <li>All outflanked opponent's discs are flipped to your color.</li>
      <li>If a player cannot make a legal move, they must pass their turn.</li>
      <li>The game ends when neither player can make a legal move, usually when the board is full.</li>
      <li>The player with the most discs of their color on the board wins. The game is a draw if both players have the same number of discs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Example</h2>
    <p>If Black plays first and places a disc at C4, it flips White's disc at D4. White then plays and may place a disc at C3, C5, or E3.</p>

    <h2>Strategy Tips</h2>
    <p>Try to control the corners and edges, as these positions are less likely to be flipped by your opponent. Maintaining flexibility and mobility can give you more options for strategic moves throughout the game.</p>
